# Project Description

Our team, SaaS Accounting Software, is working to create a product that will be used as a more manageable accounting software for small to medium sized companies than what is currently on the market. Through our software, they will be able to, in the end, enter bills, pay bills, create invoices, receive payments, and record deposits.

# Tech Stack
Scribe is run on and powered by a LAMP Stack. 
 - Operating System: Linux
 - Database: MySQL
 - Web-Server: Apache2
 - Scripting Languages: php, Bash, Python

Php is used to connect the front and back end together. Each php script either pulls data from the database and presents it on the front-end, or takes user input from the front-end and inserts it into the desired database table. Bash scripting is used to push all working files from master into an appropiate destination on our production server. We use tidy wrapped within a Python script to check that all committed front-end files are up to HTML5 standard.
